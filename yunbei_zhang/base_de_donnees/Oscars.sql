He occasionally pulls dangerous and harmful practical jokes on them with vengeance. As a result, no one likes or cares for the Grinch. Meanwhile, six-year-old Cindy Lou believes everyone is missing the point about Christmas by being more concerned about the gifts and festivities. After her two brothers are scared off by the Grinch when they trespass on his domain, and she herself has a face-to-face encounter with the Grinch at the post office, in which he reluctantly saves her life, Cindy Lou becomes interested in his history. She then asks everyone what they know about him, and soon discovers that he has a tragic past.'),
